      <h2>How the aquarium became what it is today</h2>

      <!-- Content goes in <p> here -->
      <p>
        The modern freshwater aquarium hobby is only approximately 200 years
        old! Having large glass structures with gallons of liquid and creatures
        inside is a strange concept when truly thought about. How did humans
        first think of having fish as pets? How long have fish been inside the
        home? How has the freshwater aquarium hobby changed over the centuries?
      </p>

      <p>
        To understand how the hobby became what it is today, a brief global
        history is essential to understand how the hobby migrated to the United
        States.
      </p>

      <h3>Ancient origins to the modern world</h3>

      <p>
        The beginning of the aquarium hobby started with the keeping of goldfish
        during the Song Dynasty in China. There is a written record in 1136 of
        selective goldfish breeding by Emperor Hui-Tsung to symbolize having a
        luxurious life.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">1</a>
        Many centuries later, goldfish were the first fish introduced to the New
        World in 1850, later bursting in popularity from the 1865 display at the
        New York Fair.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">2</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        While goldfish were fresh in the New World, back in Europe, Robert
        Warrington built the first aquarium that we know of today, a glass
        exterior with sand, plants, and fish.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">3</a>
        These first aquariums were basic, constructed from glass side panels
        that were press-fit together with metal side braces and a slate bottom
        to allow gas or oil to heat the tank from below using open flame. In
        late 1856 in Germany, the news of the home aquarium spread through an
        essay by Emil Adolf Roßmäßler, who is credited with the spread of the
        hobby outside of the scientific community in Europe. Roßmäßler
        introduced home aquariums to German consumers as “sea in a glass” or the
        “ocean on a table.”
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">4</a>
        Germans quickly began collecting and selling fish to the rest of Europe
        and the United States, dominating the pet trade. Roßmäßler speaks of the
        people's popularity of fish keeping of the time as “a little like
        playing God.”

      <p>
        Emil Adolf Roßmäßler’s essay inspired Henry Butler two years later to
        write the first book on the aquarium hobby in the United States, The
        Family Aquarium.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">6</a>
        This book gained the attention of many as it was a comprehensive care
        guide that allowed ordinary people, not just scientists, the knowledge
        needed to care for fish successfully. Butler's book paved the way for
        the aquarium hobby to gain tremendous interest in the world of
        literature. The first ever publication of an aquarium magazine was
        published in October of 1876 in New York titled, The New York Aquarium
        Journal.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">7</a>
        This created a hobbyist epicenter in New York City that then held the
        first aquarist society in 1893.

      <h3>Advancements in society influencing the home aquarium industry</h3>

      <p>
        The rapid technological advancements in the 1900s revolutionized the
        aquarium hobby. During this time, the United States was undergoing mass
        electrification by 1902. More homes had access to power due to the
        conversion of power line types; power lines could then carry 10
        megawatts from the previous 1 megawatt.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">9</a>
        This overflow of electricity created advancements for aeration,
        artificial lighting, electric heating of the water over oil or gas, and
        external filtration. In 1908, the first aquarium air pumps were designed
        and patented.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">10</a>
        The invention of the pump allowed for fish to travel farther distances
        and reach new areas. Fish were more accessible to communities that did
        not live directly on importing coasts. Contributing to the movement of
        fish to new places, Henry Ford broke through the world of transportation
        with the Model T. This car revolutionized the transportation of goods by
        everyday people due to the relatively low cost and accessibility for
        ordinary people to purchase.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">11</a>
        Even with the advancement of cars, the majority of the fish species
        owned as pets were native to the waterways nearest to the owner;
        hobbyists could only transport fish short distances of approximately 30
        miles for tropical species. When not importing from the common ports
        such as New York during this time, in the 1910s, many goldfish
        commercial fish breeding businesses in the United States popped up to
        distribute goldfish around each major city.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">12</a>

      <p>
        When WWI rampaged during this time, the first military planes were
        invented and allowed for people and supplies to travel even greater
        distances. By the time WWII hit in 1945, aircraft technology had come a
        long way, and vast amounts of supplies were able to travel long
        distances quickly. Commercial fish breeders from all over the world took
        advantage of the excess number of ex-combat pilots and decommissioned
        planes after the war to transport their fish to customers worldwide.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">13</a>
        Much like the addition to the automobile, this new form of
        transportation exploded the market. The addition of exotic fish, as
        opposed to the majority of the fish prior being native kept, also
        increased the popularity of the hobby. In addition, it allowed everyday
        people to have pets not seen before. Seeing a significant market
        opportunity, when plastic shopping bags were invented in the 1950s and
        in the 1960s, shipping companies began to use them to ship more fish
        utilizing a smaller space.

      <h3>Advancements in the home aquarium industry influencing society</h3>

      <p>
        Up until the 1950s, the setup and maintenance of aquariums was
        undesirable. Rapid improvements and inventions increased the popularity
        of the hobby. Since this time period, patents have been the most
        reliable timeline source because everyone claims to be the first and the
        most revolutionary to keep up with increasing demands.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the time, the way to feed captive fish was with live foods. In 1953 a
        German scientist, Dr. Ulrich Baensch created the first fish feed that
        was a high protein paste.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">14</a>
        The use of this feed allowed owners to put less effort into caring for
        their pets. The first patent in the United States for an automatic fish
        feeder came out in 1954, enabling aquarium owners to set up their tanks
        and leave them as decorative pieces.

      <p>
        The first aquarium filter was patented in 1959 and further
        revolutionized the hobby.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">16</a>
        Before this invention, it was common for the water to grow murky and
        smelly, and often many fish inhabitants would often last less than a
        year. Filters provided water flow and the knowledge of the nitrogen
        cycle’s importance in balancing the different microorganisms living
        symbiotically with the pets.

      <p>
        Dr. Baensch made a revolutionary reinvention of fish food in 1967, a
        food that was near odorless and dry and flaky, naming it TetraMin.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">17</a>
        The TetraMin fish food was rebranded to Tetra and expanded globally in
        1974, with the major export going to the United States.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">18</a>
        In addition, Flake food allowed for fish feeding to be simple and
        mess-free, further peaking the interests of many.

      <p>
        The United States in the 1970s created the modern look of the aquarium
        hobby as it is known today. The first breakthroughs came from the
        invention of using sealant materials to bind the glass panels together
        overuse of metal frames. Many different styles of aquariums were
        developed, as seen by the variation in patents. For example, the basic
        rectangular aquarium as seen today was patented in 1971,
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">19</a>
        the wall-mounted aquarium was patented a few months later,
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">20</a>
        and the self-cleaning aquarium in 1972.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">21</a>
        Improvements in aesthetics and functions previously invented continue to
        be seen into the present. Since the 1970s, the popularity of freshwater
        aquarium keeping has grown by 14% a year, with over one billion fish of
        5300 species traded internationally.

      <h3>Current standing of the aquarium hobby in the United States</h3>

      <p>
        In the United States, the fish hobby grows larger annually. The
        freshwater hobby grows by 1.5% every year, with the recent COVID-19
        pandemic increasing the hobby from 2.75% of the previous year.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">23</a>
        As of 2021, 11.8 million US households own freshwater aquarium fish.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">23</a>
        The sizable recent growth of the hobby is attributed to the
        ever-adaption of the supplies and materials to make an overall better
        experience and the growing selection of exotic and captive breed
        fascinating fishes. The most critical contributor throughout the hobby’s
        history was the technological boom of the transportation era in the
        early 1900s. Before this, aquaria were only available to persons living
        directly near breeders or shipping hubs. Now with the internet and mass
        global transit, you can have fish from all over the world shipped
        directly to your door.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shipping of fish worldwide opens up the possibility for consumers to
        select fish based on their aesthetic preferences rather than on their
        location. Unfortunately, this attitude has led to devastating
        consequences.

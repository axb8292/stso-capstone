      <h2>About me and special thanks!</h2>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <!-- Content goes in <p> here -->
      <p>
        I am Abby Brooks, a Mechanical Engineer and six year aquarium
        enthusiast. From the time I was 7 years of age, my family has had
        aquariums in our home. I took a full nose dive into the hobby during
        high school with a personal guppy breeding project and a goldfish
        research project. Since that time I have not only exponentially
        increased my number of aquariums but also my knowledge. The majority of
        my free time consists of listening to hobby podcasts or browsing YouTube
        on caring for different home species. I currently have 13 aquariums and
        plan on increasing to 15 after moving. I currently run a fish breeding
        business and sell to local hobbyists as well as adopt unwanted betta
        fish. I house three betta fish, two varieties of bristlenose plecos, one
        variety of common pleco, a variety of fancy guppies, and two varieties
        of neocaridina shrimp.

      <h3>Special thanks</h3>

      <p>
        First and foremost, a very large and special thank you to my parents for
        allowing me to take over their living room with the majority of my
        aquariums! I know you only tolerate them, but the help and support has
        been critical in blooming my interest.
      </p>

        My environmental professor for allowing me to not only work on my

        Do some research! Every fish has different care requirements and needs.
        The betta splendens and ancistrus cirrhosus require care that is
        different. Depending on your daily routine, there is a correct fish
        species for you. YouTube and online forums are great sources of
        information! Some great resources are linked below.

        Buy local! This is the best thing you can do for the animal and the
        environment. Local breeders put a lot of care in raising happy and
        healthy animals that then do not need to be shipped in from a different
        country. These consist of breeders in the hobby or small local aquarium
        stores. Your local big box store will get their animals shipped in as
        imports. The Rochester area has many hobby breeders as well as a great
        locally owned store called “Rock Beach Aquatics.” To buy from local
        hobbiests, the r/aquaswap reddit has been a good experience to work
        with.

        Consider the responsibility! All too often, fish are an impulse buy.
        Like a dog or a cat however, these animals can live a long time, some
        like ancistrus cirrhosus will live easily 10 years. Owning a fish is a
        commitment and a life to take care of, not a disposable decoration. If
        you find yourself or someone you know unable to care for their pet,
        there are many rescues online and in the community that will take in the
        unwanted animal(s). Do not flush them down the toilet or release them
        into a body of water!
      </p>

      <p>
        Dispose deceased pets with respect! When your fish dies, an all too
        common response is to flush it down the toilet. This is not only
        disrespectful to the animal, but also detrimental to the local water
        supply. When you flush a dead animal, whatever diseases or parasites
        that caused the animal to die. By burying the fish or putting it in the
        general trash or compost, the waterways remain safe.

      <h3>If you do not want fish…</h3>

      <p>
        Advocate for policy makers to take the fish trade seriously! Become
        aware of your local branches of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and
        contact them about the environmental problems caused by irresponsible
        releases of aquarium fish into local waterways.

      <p>
        If you see a fish in poor living conditions, speak up! In many offices
        or classrooms, there are fish being kept in small dirty bowls. Educating
        others is the first step into improving the lives of pet fish.

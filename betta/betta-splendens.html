      <h3>About betta splendens</h3>

      <!-- Content goes in <p> here -->
      <p>
        This beautiful fish is the common betta species sold in stores today!
        They are commonly referred to as Siamese Fighting Fish and one of the
        most popular kept fish in the world. Unlike their wild counterparts,
        they are typically very aggressive towards others in their species,
        however can sometimes get along with other fish. The majority of the
        time they require a tank to themselves. They grow between 2.4-3.5”, have
        a carnivorous diet, and thrive in temperatures between 24-28C (75-82F).
        This species consists of many fish with different colors and fin types.
        There are in total 73 different species of betta fish! Each species has
        a labyrinth organ that allows them to breathe surface oxygen which
        contributes to the misconception these fish can be kept in small spaces.
      </p>

      <h3>History of betta fish</h3>

      <p>
        The term “betta” refers to a total of 73 different species of fish, all
        of which originated from Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia,
        Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Both betta splendens and betta
        mahachaiensis species are from Thailand. The origins of keeping these
        fish as pets are unknown, however, recent research in genetics show the
        fish being first domesticated around 1000 years ago.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">24</a>
        It is known, however, that these fish were domesticated for aggression
        for fighting each other as a form of gambling.

        The King of Thailand, King Rama III, became interested in these matches
        during his reign from 1824-1851. Rama III used the fish for personal
        economic gain and to ensure his winnings, bred the fish himself.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">25</a>
        Following his winnings, in 1840 Rama III gave some of his prize fish to
        Theodore Edward Cantor, a botanist, physician, and zoologist. In 1849,
        the first record of the betta fish was written by Cantor who gave them
        the scientific name Macropodus pugnax.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">26</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1874, the first record of the betta fish outside of Asia was in
        France. Pierre Carbonnier, an ichthyologist imported pairs of bettas in
        hopes to breed and research them. Twenty years later, Paul Matte brought
        the first record of bettas into Germany from a prevalent russian
        breeder.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">27</a>
        Betta fish reached far away Australia in 1904 from Malaysia in the
        aussies eagerness to fight them. This is from a written record in an
        article by zoologist Edgar Waite.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">27</a>
        In 1909, the given scientific name of Macropodus pugnax was changed to
        betta splendens, meaning “splendid fighter” by Charles Regan, a British
        ichthyologist.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">28</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Bettas first entered the United States in 1910 when California became a
        large import center.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">26</a>
        This shift to the United States is credited as the push to breed for
        ornamental purposes instead of aggression.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">26</a>
        To further this progress, the International Betta Congress was founded
        in 1867 to breed based on health and animal welfare.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">26</a>
        Today there are 14 different fin types of betta splendens.
      </p>

      <h3>Current origin of betta splendens in the aquarium trade</h3>

      <p>
        The betta fish is the largest export of Thailand and generates over 30
        billion dollars annually.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">29</a>
        One seller states that they sell up to 30 fish a day at about 3 USD per
        fish.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">30</a>
        However, these fish being exported from far away farms for their beauty
        need to be held to high standards. When sorting the fish for export, any
        fish that are not up to the quality of the breeder are dumped into
        canals or thrown away.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">31</a>
        The “quality” that these breeders are looking for pertains to the vivid
        coloration of the fish and the shape and flow of the tail fins. These
        are all purely cosmetic and in no way hinder the life of the fish. For
        context it is important to understand the breeding cycle of these fish.
        One spawn or mating of a pair of betta fish produces anywhere from
        100-500 babies. When they reach adulthood, each fish needs their own
        tank, meaning the fish will consume an excessive number of tanks. As a
        result, the production of these fish in imports will always be larger
        than the demand. The dumped fish then compete with native fish species
        for resources, and their breed aggression causes further habitat
        destruction.

      <p>
        As mentioned, betta splendens was bred over centuries for aggression,
        this trait is much stronger than their wild betta mahachaiensis
        counterpart. Many research studies were performed and confirmed
        “domesticated strains were significantly more aggressive than wild-type
        B. splendens.”
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">25</a>
        Further DNA analysis of betta splendens,strongly highlight how different
        the fancy betta is from the wild type bettas. The difference in genetics
        shows the severity of the potential for mingling the wild type and
        domesticated fish. There are many wild types of bettas with different
        DNA by locations separated by natural geographic barriers.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">32</a>
        The wild betta due to habitat destruction through mining pollution,
        distruction for farmland, and release of the highly aggressive betta
        splendens, it is already thought to be vulnerable.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">33</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the massive economic boom to Thailand betta fish provide, there
        are no policies for the slowing of the export.
      </p>


      <h3>Betta splendens in the United States</h3>

      <p>
        There are also betta fish breeders within the United States. Instead of
        paying the sizable global transportation fees (when I imported some
        guppies from Indonesia, the total shipping and import fees totaled $150
        for nine fish, not including the cost of the fish) and the added stress
        to the fish. Being in the fish breeding business myself, I appreciate
        small-scale breeders and the time and resources to ensure healthy stock
        and humane and environmentally conscious ways to cull. I have had to
        cull for quality of life purposes such as curved spines or genetic
        virtual immune disorder. Most home breeders use clove oil sedation then
        garden burial disposal in contrast to the fish farms into waterways and
        general trash.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only do breeders have the potential to contaminate waterways, but
        the final owners in the United States as well. Many aquarists attribute
        Pixar’s 2003 children’s film, Finding Nemo, to have led to the common
        misconception that flushing fish down the toilet brings the fish
        freedom. Not only this, but also releasing the fish into the wildlife is
        the best method of disposal. This could not be further from the truth.
        Many, 65%, of the United States foreign fish are credited to have been
        initially from the pet trade.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">34</a>
        Current policies do not restrict the introductions of these pet trade
        fish to native populations; however most introduced species have the
        potential to cause devastating consequences. The pet fish trade can
        discontinue this environmentally devastating path inexpensively by
        educating the public on the dangers of pet imports and releases.

      <h3>Personal reflection of betta splendens</h3>

      <p>
        During research for this project, I went to ten different PetSmart and
        Petco locations. Of those, the number of betta fish on display ranged
        from 39 to 61. At least half in each location seemed to be acting
        lethargic and sickly. However, these fish are displayed on end caps
        featuring large colorful displays to capture the attention of impulse
        buyers. Most of these buyers have little to no experience with keeping
        fish. Any person with high-level knowledge would not purchase
        big-business livestock. This treatment is unethical towards the animals
        and not economically viable due to the unofficial average life span of
        one of these fish to be a month.

      <p>
        In the past three years since I have started keeping betta fish, I have
        had 5 bettas. Out of this bunch, I have only bought one. The rest came
        to me in various stages of being “thrown away.” I purchased my first
        fish Betta Boi from a reputable seller that I traveled across the
        country on my 21st birthday to visit. My second betta Patriot was given
        to me by my local fish store when I traded some of my home-bred fish.
        Patriot had been there several months and was not selling. Then I got
        Sylvia. She was plain blue and had ripped fins. The prior owner was a
        college student who did not think having a fish would be so
        labor-intensive. A month later, Steve, hanging onto life by a tiny
        thread, was rushed to me. His owner asked for my fish advice but did not
        take it. Instead, they impulse-bought him at the store and kept him in a
        small plastic container until he was floating upside down and barely
        breathing. After weeks of hard recovery, I decided to keep him in my
        care. Tragedy hit when Steve’s tank had a massive ecosystem crash, and
        sadly he did not make it. Sylvia died a day later after being taken by
        gluttony as she drowned chasing a shrimp into a small log. After
        mourning and burial, I took on treating the latest addition, Starburst,
        from a betta rescue support group for undernutrition and lack of muscle
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I treasure all of these fish as much as my cat. We have a betta wall
        with all their photos hanging so we can remember them and our time
        together. Without stepping in, the majority of these fish would have
        ended up without ever seeing a real plant and flushed down a toilet or
        into the waterways to be thrown away, just like before the export
        process even began.
      </p>

      <p>
        You might think that betta splendens are the only species that seems to
        be disposable and causes damage in this hobby, unfortunately that is not
        the case.

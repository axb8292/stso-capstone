      <h2>Information about hypostomus plecostomus</h2>

      <!-- Content goes in <p> here -->
      <p>
        This fish is a type of catfish sold in stores today. They are commonly
        referred to as common plecos and one of the most popular kept fish in
        the world due to their nature of consuming unwanted algae in the home
        aquarium. These fish are more aggressive than the smaller ancistrus and
        may attack other fish over territory. They grow between 11-20”, have an
        omnivorous diet, and thrive in temperatures between 23-30C (73-86F). Due
        to their bottom feeding nature, and massive size, they are large
        producers of waste and require a minimum of 75 gallons per fish. This
        species consists of one variation of color and fin type. Hypostomus
        plecostomus is able to intake surface oxygen and absorb it using their
        specialized stomachs.

      <h3>History of pleco fish</h3>

      <p>
        The common name of “pleco” is used in the hobby to encompass both
        ancistrus cirrhosus and hypostomus plecostomus. These two species share
        only their scientific family and are part of much different genuses.
        Both species originated from the tropical freshwaters of South America,
        largely Brazil.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">35</a>
        The origins of keeping these fish as pets are unknown, however, recent
        research in genetics shows hypostomus and ancistrus species diverged in
        the Upper Rio Paraná and Eastern Coastal Rivers 4.2 million years ago.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">35</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        It is uncertain who was responsible for the introduction of pleco fish
        into the aquarium hobby. It is known however that in the 1950s pleco
        fish were brought to the United States from their origin in South
        America for ornamental purposes in the aquarium hobby.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">36</a>
        Over time, these fish exploded in numbers and popularity for being the
        aquarium's cleaner fish. Today, ancistrus cirrhosus continues to grow
        further in popularity for their widening variety of fin type and
        coloration while hypostomus plecostomus grows in notoriety for their
        devastating environmental impacts.
      </p>

      <h3>Current origin of pleco fish in the aquarium trade</h3>

      <p>
        The freshwater fish industry in Brazil is the largest in South America,
        exporting over 1 billion dollars annually.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">37</a>
        The freshwater pet trade has shrunken in South America as a whole and
        Brazil specifically over the past decade. As the increase of countries
        become aware of the detrimental risk of releasing hypostomus
        plecostomus, less orders are coming both in and out of the country.
        There has been a sharp shift from the Brazilian government to focus on
        domestic sustainable capture and production.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">37</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        An exponential decline in Brazil’s zebra pleco population caused a
        country wide endangered analysis. In the Xingu River in Brazil the zebra
        pleco is endangered due to habitat modification and overfishing for the
        pet industry; the zebra pleco is one of the most exported fish out of
        Brazil. Many consumers do not realize their purchase supports wildlife
        trafficking. The Brazil government bans keeping the fish as pets,
        however scientists argue for the country to have breeding programs for
        export as well as to conserve the wild populations.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">38</a>
        A study was quickly performed and found 35 other species in the same
        region as the zebra pleco were critically endangered. As a result,
        Brazil created many government enforced protected areas.

      </figure>

      <p>
        Breeding habits of the different types of plecos has a large impact on
        the severity of the ecological impact. Ancistrus cirrhosus produces
        150-200 fry per spawn while hypostomus plecostomus produces 500-700 fry.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">36</a>
        The large size of hypostomus plecostomus is already environmentally
        difficult however is worsened by the large spawn size. Zebra plecos in
        contrast produce 7-15 fry.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concern for the ecosystem raised moral concerns for the treatment of
        the fish during transport. Reach studies sectioned by the government
        were conducted on the overall health of animals that were exported. It
        was concluded that the transport conditions of the plecos produce deadly
        high levels of stress that continue for up to 24 hours after arriving at
        their destination.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">40</a>
        As a result, the ethics of exporting and importing fish from far off
        countries was declared as questionable by the Brazilian government due
        to confinement in inhumane conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Brazil strives to protect and establish its wild populations by
        slowing the exports, the outlook for the United States seems uncertain.
      </p>

      <h3>Pleco fish in the United States</h3>

      <p>
        There are also pleco fish breeders within the United States. It is
        incredibly rare for any hobbyist to breed hypostomus plecostomus due to
        their large size and lack of public demand. Ancistrus cirrhosus has a
        large breeding following and it is easy to find a local breeder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hypostomus plecostomus release into local ecosystems is attributed to
        the final owners in the United States. Many aquarists attribute Pixar’s
        2003 children’s film, Finding Nemo, to have led to the common
        misconception that flushing fish down the toilet brings the fish
        freedom. Not only this, but also releasing the fish into the wildlife is
        the best method of disposal. This could not be further from the truth.
        Many, 65%, of the United States foreign fish are credited to have been
        initially from the pet trade.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">34</a>
        Current policies do not restrict the introductions of these pet trade
        fish to native populations; however most introduced species have the
        potential to cause devastating consequences. The pet fish trade can
        discontinue this environmentally devastating path inexpensively by
        educating the public on the dangers of pet imports and releases.

        Florida has been battling with exponential hypostomus plecostomus
        numbers for the past decade. In many of the bodies of water, there is an
        excessive amount of plecos; due to the plecos breeding habits, many
        shorelines have holes or borrows in them for spawning and nesting sites.
        The burrows can affect the bank stability and the erosion rate at the
        shorelines. “In larger reaches of some waterways, burrows created by
        Pterygoplichthys number in the hundreds or even thousands.”

        The United States Federal Government created the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
        Service in 1940 as an agency dedicated to the management of fish,
        wildlife, and natural habitats. This agency creates reports called an
        “Ecological Risk Screening Summary” on various species as a way to
        classify the risk level of the different species. These summaries are
        performed every few years for a particular species to historically track
        the species ecological presence. In 2018, the agency reported that the
        history of the invasiveness is high, the climate match preference is
        high, the certainty of assessment is medium, and the overall risk
        assessment category is high. “There are many well documented ecological
        and economic impacts due to introductions of Hypostomus plecostomus.”
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">42</a>
        However, in the same year, the agency reported that ancistrus
        cirrhosus's history of invasiveness is uncertain, the climate match
        preference is medium, the certainty of assessment is low, and the
        overall risk assessment category is uncertain.
        <a href="./references.html" class="ref">43</a>
        Overall, ancistrus cirrhosus as known currently, is the most sustainable
        common type of pleco.

      <h3>Personal reflection of pleco fish</h3>

      <p>
        I am someone who is able to admit my shortcomings. I own a common pleco.
        His name is Toothless, of my fathers request, and we have had him for
        about ten years. Like so many others, my parents gifted me an aquarium
        for Christmas without fully understanding fish care or the details of
        fish ownership. Toothless lived in our 37 gallon aquarium and reached 10
        inches. When I became interested in fish and the aquarium hobby, I
        quickly learned our tank was much too small for him and not wanting to
        rehome Toothless, my parents gifted me a 75 gallon tank to replace the
        old one. To this day, he is still with us and lives his days in this new
        aquarium, seemingly to have reached a stagnant 11 inches. This is
        uncommon for his size to remain this small, however due to his
        behaviors, I fully believe that we caused him permanent stunted growth
        and as a result brain damage.

      <p>
        Currently I mostly house, breed and sell bristlenose plecos. I believe
        in the importance of making sure hobbyists have affordable sustainable
        fish options, in my experience the common plecos are much cheaper than
        their bristlenose counterparts. I also have a personal bias on how
        beautiful the longfin varieties of the bristlenose plecos are. I keep
        longfin chocolates and longfin lemon blue eye varieties!

      <h3>Doesn't this all sound familiar?</h3>

      <p>
        This section seems scarily similar to the betta fish section. This is
        exactly the point. Both betta fish and pleco fish are massive parts of
        the aquarium hobby in the United States. Both of these fish have massive
        potential to have devastating and lasting consequences on the country's
        ecosystem. Both of these fish will need to rely on educated hobbyists
        making informed decisions in order to sustainably thrive.
